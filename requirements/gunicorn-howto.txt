# Unfortunately because system daemon doesn't seem to want to start a virtualenv made with envwrapper's workon command, I had to find a workaround to automatically start
# my gunicorn command. In the end I got it to work by calling a bash script from the systemd script.

#
# In your home directory place the following bash script and make sure your virtualenvwrapper lines are in .profile instead of .bashrc
#
#

#!/bin/bash

source /home/testinggoat/.profile
workon django-test
cd /home/testinggoat/sites/django-test.iman.vanassum.net/source
/home/testinggoat/.virtualenvs/django-test/bin/gunicorn --bind unix:/tmp/django-test.iman.vanassum.net.socket superlists.wsgi:application

#
# In your /etc/systemd/system folder make a gunicorn-<domain name> file with the following content:
#
#
